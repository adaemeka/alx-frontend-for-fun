Web forms are a necessity and often a pain point for both designers and users.
Over time, users have formed expectations of how a form should look and behave.
They typically expect Web forms to have the following six components:

Labels
These tell users what the corresponding input fields mean.

Input Fields
Input fields enable users to provide feedback. They include text fields, password fields, check boxes, radio buttons, sliders and more.

Actions
These are links or buttons that, when pressed by the user, perform an action, such as submitting the form.

Help
This provides assistance on how to fill out the form.

Messages
Messages give feedback to the user based on their input.
They can be positive (such as indicating that the form was submitted successfully)
or negative (“The user name you have selected is already taken”).

Validation
These measures ensure that the data submitted by the user conforms to acceptable parameters.
